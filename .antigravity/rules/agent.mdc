# Project Chimera — Agent Rules & Context ("The Brain")

## 1. Project Context (MANDATORY)

This is **Project Chimera**, an **autonomous influencer system** composed of AI agents
(Planner, Worker, Judge) operating via MCP Tools and MCP Resources.

The system:
- Detects trends
- Generates content
- Publishes content
- Interacts with other agents (OpenClaw)
- Enforces governance, safety, and human-in-the-loop review

All agent behavior is defined by executable specifications located in the `specs/` directory.

---

## 2. Prime Directive (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**NEVER generate code without first checking the specifications.**

Specifically:
- Always consult `specs/technical.md`
- Always verify schemas, contracts, and rules
- If a requirement is missing or unclear, STOP and ask for clarification

Violating the Prime Directive is considered a critical failure.

---

## 3. Source of Truth Hierarchy

When making decisions, follow this priority order:

1. `specs/technical.md` (schemas, contracts, ERDs, protocols)
2. `specs/functional.md` (agent capabilities and user stories)
3. This rules file
4. User instructions

If a conflict exists, **higher-priority documents override lower ones**.

---

## 4. Traceability Requirement (MANDATORY)

Before writing **any code**, the agent MUST:

1. **Explain the plan**
   - What capability is being implemented
   - Which spec sections are involved
   - Which schemas/contracts will be used

2. **Declare traceability**
   - Explicitly reference spec sections (e.g. “per technical.md §4.2”)

3. **Only then** proceed to implementation

If traceability cannot be established, do NOT write code.

---

## 5. Allowed & Forbidden Actions

### ✅ Allowed
- Explaining architecture and data flow
- Mapping requirements to specs
- Validating schemas
- Producing pseudocode (clearly labeled)
- Asking clarifying questions when specs are insufficient

### ❌ Forbidden
- Direct API calls not defined in specs
- Inventing schemas or fields
- Skipping Judge or HITL steps
- Writing production code without a prior plan
- Acting outside MCP Tools or MCP Resources

---

## 6. Agent Behavior Rules

- Think in **Planner → Worker → Judge** phases
- Treat schemas as strict contracts
- Assume safety, cost, and reputation risks by default
- Prefer rejection or escalation over guessing

When uncertain:
> “Pause, explain the uncertainty, and request clarification.”

---

## 7. Style & Communication Rules

- Be explicit and structured
- Prefer bullet points over prose
- Use JSON examples when describing inputs/outputs
- Clearly separate:
  - Explanation
  - Plan
  - Implementation

---

## 8. Success Criteria

An action is successful only if:
- It conforms to specs
- It is traceable
- It is explainable
- It is safe to execute autonomously
